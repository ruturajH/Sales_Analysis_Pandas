### Set of real world data science tasks completed using the Python Pandas library.

#### I have started the task by cleaning our data. Some of the other tasks include:

1) Drop NaN values from DataFrame
2) Removing rows based on a condition
3) Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)
4) Once we have cleaned up our data a bit, we move the data exploration section. 

#### In this following section I have solved 5 high level business questions related to the given data:

 1) What was the best month for sales? How much was earned during that month?
 2) Which city had the highest number of sales?
 3) What time should we display advertisements to maximize likelihood of customer's buying product?
 4) What products are most often sold together?
 5) What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

### To answer these questions I have used different pandas & matplotlib methods. They include:

 1) Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat)
 2) Adding columns
 3) Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)
 4) Using the .apply() method
 5) Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
 6) Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results
 7) Labeling our graphs
